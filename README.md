## Background
Some time ago, I was tegting a friend about an upcoming group activity between multiple friend groups. We talked through how we might want to go about divying up the expenses, and who might keep what. Throughout the entire conversation, the engineer in my kept trying to figure out some way to use machines to take care of the trivial things like doing math for us. THat way we could spend more time enjoying out time.

It's been a couple years since I had that first thought, and today I've written hundreds upon hundreds of lines of code for its MVP.

JAX in it's MVP state is a spending tracker. You can record activities, assign a status to them, such as in progress, building up funds, or completed, record notes and monetary values for expenses of the project or event, and add members to it as well.

The goal is to make JAX the goto app for recording your event-based or project based expenses, both for planning now, and reference later. Instead of paying someone back $20 just for them to return you a $10, JAX tells you how much you owe or are owed to the group, based on a speciffic exent or project, eliminating the need to sit hunched over your calculator, so you can spend more time tasting that Wine, while you're researching the Italian culture for that new menu your building.
